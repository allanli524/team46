-   Join a chatroom and enter messages (using input textbox) to communicate in real time with other users.

-   Navigate to the left side panel of the chatroom to click on participants. Once a participant is clicked (denoted by their name(alias)), a popup display is opened allowing
    users to report the user or invite him to a private chatroom.

-   Chat with individual users in a private chatroom

## Admin functionalities
